# Flutter Directory

The two folders in this directory refer to our two different flutter applications. 

the first flutter application, the camera simulator, refers to an applicatio we made that would simulate the security camera we use for our application. Because we were unable to use an actual security camera, we decided to create an application that would act as one. The application would use the mobile phone's camera and send a few pictures every second to our server.

Our second flutter application is our main application that would be given to and downloaded by users. They would be able to login to their accounts and then access their Fortress system that they have setup at home.
